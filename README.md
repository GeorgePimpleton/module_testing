# C++20/23 Module Testing

### Background
C/C++ have changed since 2003/2004.  C++20 introduced a new method for creating custom content, via module interface files instead of headers, etc.  Programmers need to adapt.

### Why this github repository exists
Because using modules can be fraught with frusttration if not properly set up.

### Compiler used
I used Visual Studio 2022 (Community) to create and test the code.  Currently I am using VS 2022, setting the C++ language standard to /std:c++latest (C++23 features).

You should think about using VS 2022 as well.  It's free for the Community edition.

### Notes
There may be links to websites or internet sources in these pages and source code. Links can go stale. A search engine is your friend.

This is a "work in progress", there is no guarantee this will be nothing more than a repo dump of test snippets.  There is also no guarantee the source files will work for you.  Especially if you don't use Visual Studio as your compiler.  At this time only VS is 100% compliant for C++20.  No compiler is complete C++23 compliant.

If you find better ways to rework the code don't hesitate to let me know.
