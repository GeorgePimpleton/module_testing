### Background
C/C++ have changed since 2003/2004.  C++20 introduced a new method for creating custom content, via module interface files instead of headers, etc.  Programmers need to adapt.

### What this does
Using a custom function.  Not much changes from each snippet of code other than how C++ stdlib functionality is accessed.
