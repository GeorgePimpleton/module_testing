### Background
C/C++ have changed since 2003/2004.  C++20 introduced a new method for creating custom content, via module interface files instead of headers, etc.  Programmers need to adapt.

### What this does
The custom function is placed in a header/module interface file.

FYI, the file extension I use for a C++ header is .hpp, for a C++ module interface is .ixx.  .ixx is used by Visual Studio, .cppm by Clang and .cxx by GCC (kinda).
