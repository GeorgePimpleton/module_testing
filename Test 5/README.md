### Background
C/C++ have changed since 2003/2004.  C++20 introduced a new method for creating custom content, via module interface files instead of headers, etc.  Programmers need to adapt.

### What this does
Separating files into interface and implementation files

#Note
A module implementation file is also known in Visual Studio as a "module internal partition" file.  This type of file needs to be manually modified in the VS IDE to compile as "module internal partition".
