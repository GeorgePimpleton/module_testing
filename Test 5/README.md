### Background
C/C++ have changed since 2003/2004.  C++20 introduced a new method for creating custom content, via module interface files instead of headers, etc.  Programmers need to adapt.

### What this does
C++20/C++23 have formatting library support, this is just a very brief overview.

FYI, the pre-C++20 example uses the C library ::printf.  Using std::cout also works with I/O manipulators <iomanip>.

Using <iomanip> is a "study on your own" subject, thankyouverymuch.
